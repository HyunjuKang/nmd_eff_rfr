### W1 \& Q2: Clarity of disscusion

we recommend that practitioners choose $k$ to match the important range of $k$-hop in the embedding space, together with taking into account downstream tasks. A wider range of top-$k$ in $Importance$ enforces to find the explanation that brings signification changes in more wider neighborhood and consequently, the change of top-$k$ neighboring nodes affects related downstream tasks in Table 2, 3. Setting such a wider range of top-$k$ does not make sense considering the downstream tasks such as top-$k$ link prediction. We conduct the top-$5$ link-prediction tasks in a general setting. For the above reason, we set $k$ as $5$ in our experiments as unified settings.

Additionally, We conduct experiments on the CiteSeer dataset to observe the effect of top-$k$ regarding $imporance$. As shown in this attached [figure] (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/unr0929/neighbor_cnt.jpg), importance by top-$k$ differs by datasets. On the Cora dataset, Importance decreases as $k$ increases, which means that a node of interest still has a similar distance with distant neighbor nodes. However, on the CiteSeer dataset, the importance is less affected by $k$, which means that a node of interest totally changes the neighborhood. We assume that this is due to the degree of the input graph. CiteSeer has an average degree of around 2, while Cora has an average degree of around 3. Thus, a more sparse graph such as CiteSeer has more effect from the perturbation by locating different neighborhoods because we observe that a wider range of top-$k$ shows a similar level of $Importance$.
